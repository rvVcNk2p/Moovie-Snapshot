I love films. So, I created Moovie. 🎬 But why?
Through the years I watched tons of films, but as I get older 😅 .. my mind is not as sharp as it was in my early years.

If you need a nice film idea for the upcoming movie night or want to find a similar movie to Inception, etc.. Moovie will be the best choice.

Search by hand-crafted categories, add your already seen movies to your Library or save them to your Watchlist for next time. Register your free profile today and say goodbye to the endless scrolling at the start of your movie date night.
